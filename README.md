Open Data Community Architecture (ODCA) outlines City's new approach to data management with the goal to enable the City to - 
-	Build a robust and scalable infrastructure to support growing data access and analytics needs.
- Improve citizen experience by enabling data sharing through a scalable, high-performance platform.
- Advance municipal services through data-driven decisions using machine learning solutions.
- Execute on San José’s Smart City vision via Open Source and Open Community approaches

The City is looking for community feedback on the ODCA to make it a global architecture that can be easily adopted by anyone looking to learn from data and helping make better decisions through data.
